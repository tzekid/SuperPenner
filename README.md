### Idea ###

We develop a browser-based Game regarding Hobos with superpowers gained by the consume of alien cracktonite wich came from alieninvaders currently running the world 
by infiltrating all government-based Sozialamt. The Goal is to get a paycheck from the Sozialamt by fighting the Aliens with your new gained superpowers and Items.

You can Play in three different factions (Kinderarmut, Gescheiterte Existenz, Altersarmut)

You can find crazy Items to up your stats

And with that sweet sweet cracktonite from the ALiens you can get fancy as a cisco hobo in the 70's
