# SuperPenner

## **Idea**

In this browser-based game, you play as a hobo who gains superpowers by consuming alien-derived "cracktonite." These aliens have infiltrated the world, taking control of government agencies like the Sozialamt. 

### **Game Objective**
Your goal is to fight the aliens and use your superpowers and items to secure a paycheck from the Sozialamt.

### **Factions**
Choose to play as one of three factions:
- **Kinderarmut** (Child Poverty)
- **Gescheiterte Existenz** (Failed Existence)
- **Altersarmut** (Elderly Poverty)

### **Gameplay Features**
- **Crazy Items:** Discover wild items to boost your stats.
- **Cracktonite Upgrades:** Use alien cracktonite to enhance your style and powersâ€”become as flashy as a '70s hobo from San Francisco!
